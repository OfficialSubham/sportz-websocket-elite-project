Today I learned about using drizzle orm which is just like prisma but more sql friendly
cause the function used their is just like sql commands
Switching to other branches and sending a pr, and got to know that in production this happens
Also used code rabbit but not able to get the summary of my database pr cause i think that was because the pr was created before using code rabbit. Now I have to check for it in the next PRs
Funny thing I used drizzle schema and there was a problem in check constraint so I actually deleted the drizzle and again generate it.
Now I know I should actually alter the data directly in sql
